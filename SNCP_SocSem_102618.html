# Theoretical Framework 

---

# Broken Windows

Wilson &amp; Kelling (1982) describe a system where disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control and (2) decreases social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* B, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* C, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy—the capacity for informal social control.

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.

* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy—social control—which is exogenous (B, E).

*A, C, and E represent testable constraints on Broken Windows.*

# Key Literature

.pull-left[
[**Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999)**](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356)

* Neighborhood instrumental variables model

* Effect of disorder on crime (A) absent once controlling for collective efficacy (B,D)

* Control for effect of crime on collective efficacy (E), but assume no effect of disorder on collective efficacy (C)
]

.pull-right[
[**Keizer et al. (2008)**](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1161405)

* Multiple field experiments in single sites

* Strong causal effect of disorder on norm violation (A)

* No contextual controls

* No examination of indirect pathways or reciprocal effects

*How do we reconcile these results?*

# Prosocial Behavior

Engaging in social control is a prosocial behavior

Collective efficacy also predicts non-sanctioning prosocial behavior—returning lost letters, providing CPR (Sampson, 2008)

Broken windows implies disorder attenuates prosocial action through social withdrawal

# Research Questions

Our goal is examination of the micro-processes that underlie Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy

--

Does disorder increase norm-violations and crime as suggested by Broken Windows?

* Does disorder also inhibit prosocial behavior?

--

Or is this relationship spurious once collective efficacy is controlled, as suggest by Sampson?

* Is activation of collective efficacy conditional on offender characteristics?
* Does disorder moderate collective efficacy?

# Project Structure

---

This study links field experiments embedded in Seattle neighborhoods 
to data from the 2002-2003 Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey.

--

The results represent the result of over 2000 person-hours of field work spread over four summers.

# Lost Letter

.pull-left[
![Mailbox Experiment](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/lost_letter.svg)
]

.pull-right[
* Based on Sampson's (2012) application of the Lost Letter Technique (Milgram et al. 1965) to obtain updated measure of collective efficacy.

* Returning a lost letter is a low-risk pro-social intervention.

* Varying the sender address allows for test of pro-social intervention sensitivity to contextual variation.
