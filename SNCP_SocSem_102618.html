# Theoretical Framework 

---

# Broken Windows

Wilson &amp; Kelling (1982) describe a system where disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control and (2) decreases social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.

.pull-left60[

![Broken Windows](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/broken_windows_pretty.svg)

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* B, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* C, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.

*This model is under-identified without instruments or manipulations*

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy—the capacity for informal social control.

![Collective Efficacy](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/collective_efficacy_pretty.svg)
]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.

* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy—social control—which is exogenous (B, E).

*A, C, and E represent testable constraints on Broken Windows.*

# Key Literature

.pull-left[
[**Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999)**](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356)

* Instrumental variables model of Chicago neighborhoods

* Effect of disorder on crime (A) absent once controlling for collective efficacy (B,D)

* Controlled for effect of crime on collective efficacy (E), but assumed no effect of disorder on collective efficacy (C)
]

.pull-right[
[**Keizer et al. (2008)**](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1161405)

* Multiple field experiments in Grongingen, the Netherlands

* Strong causal effect of disorder on norm violation (A)

* No contextual controls: Single site per experiment

* No examination of indirect pathways or reciprocal effects

*How do we reconcile these results?*

# Prosocial Behavior

Engaging in social control—such as sanctioning—is a prosocial behavior

Collective efficacy also predicts non-sanctioning prosocial behavior—returning lost letters, providing CPR (Sampson, 2008)

Broken windows implies disorder attenuates prosocial action through social withdrawal

---

# Research Questions

Our goal is examination of the micro-processes that underlie Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy

--

Does disorder increase norm-violations and crime as suggested by Broken Windows?
* Does disorder also inhibit prosocial behavior?

--

Or is this relationship spurious once collective efficacy is controlled, as suggest by Sampson?
* Is activation of collective efficacy conditional on offender characteristics?
* Does disorder moderate collective efficacy?

--

To answer these questions, this study links field experiments embedded in Seattle neighborhoods 
to data from the 2002-2003 Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey.

# Experiments and Goals:

* Lost Letter
   * Updated measure of collective efficacy

* Mailbox Experiment
   * Causal effect of disorder on norm violation (A)
   
* Littering Intervention
   * Causal effect of disorder on sanctioning (B)
   * Causal effect of interpersonal context on sanctioning (this is *not* E)
   * Association of collective efficacy with sanctioning (is this actually C?)

* Litter Clean-Up
   * Assocation of collective efficacy with disorder removal (D)

# Lost Letter

.pull-left[
![Mailbox Experiment](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/lost_letter.svg)
]

.pull-right[
* Based on Sampson's (2012) application of the Lost Letter Technique (Milgram et al. 1965) to obtain updated measure of collective efficacy.

* Returning a lost letter is a low-risk pro-social intervention.

* Varying the sender address allows for test of pro-social intervention sensitivity to contextual variation.

We aren't testing any path at all here. We could use the original diagram and add a box for prosocial action and an association link with collective efficacy.

# Mailbox Experiment

.pull-left[
![Mailbox Experiment](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/mailbox_experiment.svg)
]

.pull-right[
* Test of direct effect of disorder on norm violation.

* Test of direct effect of disorder on low-risk prosocial intervention.

* Capture correlation between collective efficacy and norm violation.
]

Notes: We really are testing A. But we're also testing something else: Does disorder impact prosocial behavior, which is a product of collective efficacy. Add a new box for that? We are also observationally testing D.

# Littering Intervention

.pull-left[
![Mailbox Experiment](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/littering_intervention.svg)
]

.pull-right[
* Test of direct effect of disorder on sanctioning.

* Test of effect of norm violation context on sanctioning.

* Captures correlation between collective efficacy and sanctioning.
]

Notes: What we're actually testing here is disorder -&gt; sanctioning (C), collective efficacy -&gt; sanctioning (not labeled), and interpersonal context -&gt; sanctioning (not labeled). Need a new diagram.

# Litter Clean-Up

Notes: Here we would be observationally testing collective efficacy -&gt; disorder (B)... or would we be testing collective efficacy -&gt; prosocial behavior -&gt; disorder?

---

# Synthesis

Notes:

Disorder appears to attenuate prosocial action (mailbox experiment; what about littering?)

Collective efficacy predicts low risk prosocial action (lost letter, mailbox? (check), litter pickup)

CE predicts reduced theft, but not increased sanctioning

Interpersonal context appears to matter; context in general appears to matter (disorder is contextual info)
