# Theoretical Framework 

### Neighborhood social control and crime

???

Our focus crime

Crime always has risks

Prosocial action does not always have risk but risk is an underappreciated element

---

# Broken Windows

[Wilson &amp; Kelling (1982)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/) describe a system where community disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control to offenders and (2) decreases actual social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* B, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* C, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy—the community's capacity for informal social control.

![Collective Efficacy](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/collective_efficacy_pretty.svg)

.pull-right40[
* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy—social control—which is exogenous (B, E).

* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.

# Key Question

### How do we reconcile these results?

--

### *But first, an aside...*

---

# Prosocial Behavior and Risk

Our focus is on crime—which always has risks—but both Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy are also theories of **prosocial behavior**.

--

Broken windows implies disorder attenuates prosocial behavior through *fear of crime* and subsequent withdrawal from community life.

--

Collective efficacy predicts many prosocial behaviors:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Returning lost letters
* Voting
* Providing CPR
* Sanctioning norm-violators

.footnote[[1] [Sampson (2012)](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo5514383.html)]

--

Engaging in social control—sanctioning—is a *risky prosocial behavior*.

--

Prosocial action does not always feature risk but *risks and costs of prosocial behavior are underappreciated elements*.

---

# Research Questions

Our goal is testing the micro-level mechanisms that underlie Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy.

--

Does disorder increase norm-violations and crime as suggested by Broken Windows?
* Does disorder also inhibit prosocial behavior?

--

Or is this relationship spurious once collective efficacy is controlled, as suggested by Sampson?
* Is activation of collective efficacy conditional on context?
* Does disorder moderate collective efficacy?
* Does collective efficacy limit exposure to disorder via clean-up?

--

.centernote[
*To answer these questions, this study links field experiments embedded in Seattle neighborhoods to ecometric data from the 2002-2003 Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey.*

Paths E and C are hard to isolate

Can't use crime as an intervention

Crime is a rare event to observe

Sanctioning is difficult intervention

# The Experiments

---
# Lost Letter: Method

2,938 letters were dropped on Seattle sidewalks for passersby to encounter.

--

24 letters—8 per addressee—were dropped in each census tract:
  * Charles F. Landers Sr. (Personal)
  * Friends of Black Lives Matter (BLM)
  * American Neo-Nazi Party (Nazi)

--

Mailed letters were received at a PO Box monitored by the research team.

--

Letter ID numbers combine with hand-recorded drop locations to permit geotagging of letter returns.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[[1] Letter condition, area type (e.g. residential), and postmark date were also recorded. Addresses have also now been linked to election precincts (See Appendix).]

Key Findings:

* Personal (0.346) and BLM (0.318) returns correlated with 2002-2003 collective efficacy.

--

* Nazi letter returns uncorrelated with CE (.034) and less common.

--

* Return rates of Personal and BLM letters should provide a valid updated collective efficacy indicator.

???

Logit model indicates CE predicts BLM and personal letters

Interaction with Nazi negates CE effect

BLM has a lower base return rate

Key Findings:

* Disorder has no impact on theft.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[[1] There is no significant positive relationship in *any* location.]
--

* Disorder reduces the likelihood of mailing—resulting in the letter remaining on the ground longer.

--

* Collective efficacy is associated with lower theft, but not more mailing.


---

## Littering Intervention: Method

A confederate walks down the street and flagrantly litters near a trash can in view of passersby.

--

Researchers record whether the confederate is sanctioned—a risky prosocial behavior—or the litter is disposed of by a participant—a low-risk prosocial behavior.

--

Litter and a sign board with graffiti are introduced to manipulate disorder.

--

Replicated with three confederates of varying sex and race to manipulate interpersonal context which may influence evaluations of risk:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
   * Black Male
   * White Male
   * White Female

.footnote[[1] Sex and race also interact with normative expectations.]
--

We conducted 576 trials in 12 Seattle census tracts.

Key Findings:

* No *unconditional* effect of disorder on sanctions—a risky prosocial action.
   * Disorder *interacts* with confederate race/gender.

--
* Collective efficacy and letter returns did not predict sanctioning (M).

--
* Sanctioning varies widely by confederate in both *quantity* and *content*.
   * White female received more *aggressive* sanctions, usually from men.
   * Black male received *passive* sanctions only from women.
   * White male received *balanced* sanctions.

    &lt;td&gt;.057&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;.047&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

We also evaluated if our interventions impacted throwing away the dropped litter—a low risk, non-confrontational prosocial action.

--

Key Findings:

* Disorder treatment reduces throwing away.

    * This effect also conditional on confederate characteristics.
--

* Collective efficacy and letter returns do not predict throwing away.

* The experiment was abandoned after a small number of trials.

* In Ravenna, residents reported the magazine racks on Nextdoor as an "eyesore".

--

* Two magazine racks had locks cut and were removed.

--

* Thus we were unable to continue experiment *because of collective efficacy* in an affluent neighborhood.

--

* In contrast, one rack was left *for an entire year* in Capitol Hill without issue.

1\.  No disorder effect on theft (A).
   * Unable to replicate Keizer et al. (2008)

2\. Disorder attenuates low-risk, low-cost prosocial actions—mailing letters, throwing away litter—and possibly sanctioning as well (B).
   * Consistent with indirect Broken Windows pathway.
   
   * Suggests feedback effect on collective efficacy.

3\. Collective efficacy predicts some low-risk prosocial action (H,K) but not higher risk actions—sanctioning.
* Sanctioning is thought to be a key mechanism.
* May have insufficient power to detect effect.


4\. Collective efficacy is associated with lower theft (C).
* Unable to explore mechanism.
* Possibly correlated with perceived *risk* of sanction.

5\. Context matters for prosocial behavior (I).
   * Addresses of letters impact mailing.
   * Target characteristics impact sanctioning.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
   * Activation of collective efficacy is task and context specific.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

# Prosocial Behavior
### Future research

*We know relatively little about the activation of prosocial behavior, particularly sanctioning.*

--

This study suggests contexts of prosocial behavior are important but neglected considerations for neighborhood theories of crime.

--

   * Collective efficacy is correlated with the presence of risk factors—such as retaliation from the sanctioned.

--

   * Disorder may be a signal for risks or other costs.

--

   * Disorder may signal that interventions will have limited benefit.

--

   * Context may cause general statements of prosocial intentions to differ sharply from actual behavior (see [St. Jean 2007](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo5298963.html)).

# Litter Clean-Up: Alternative

We supposed the speed of return of lost letters was correlated with clean-up time of trash.


As a pilot, in selected trats, 24 pieces of litter were dropped in the same locations as lost letters and then checked three times over the course of a day.


Neither timing nor a binary measure of clean-up were found to be associated with either lost letter returns or overall collective efficacy.

## Sampson &amp; Raudenbush Replication

We replicated Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999) but with an instruments for disorder and collective efficacy from Miethe (1990) to examine reciprocal effects.

   * Disorder in 2002-2003 instrumented by 1990 disorder.
   
   * Collective Efficacy in 2002-2003 instrumented by 1990 social cohesion, reciprocated exchange, and intergenerational closure.

Key Findings:

* Disorder predicts crime in both high and low crime neighborhoods.

* Collective efficacy only predicts crime in low crime neighborhoods.

* Disorder and collective efficacy have bidirectional negative relationship.
