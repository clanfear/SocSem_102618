# Theoretical Framework 

---

# Broken Windows

Wilson &amp; Kelling (1982) describe a system where disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control and (2) decreases social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* C, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* B, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.
]

.centernote[
*Reciprocal relationships (B,C; E,D) defy observational tests.*

# Evidence

Keizer, Lindenberg, and Steg (2008)

Skogan (1990)

# Collective Efficacy

Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy---the capacity for informal social control.

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.

* B, D: Disorder and crime are products of low social control, which is exogenous (C, E).

# Evidence

Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999)

Effect of disorder on crime absent once controlling for collective efficacy.

Controlled for Crime -&gt; Collective Efficacy (E)

Assumption no effect of Disorder -&gt; Collective Efficacy (C)

## Counterpoint

Hipp (2016)
Xu, Fiedler, and Flaming (2005)

Something on prosocial behavior?

# Research Questions

Our goal is examination of the micro-processes that underlie Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy

--

Does disorder increase norm-violations and crime as suggested by Broken Windows?

* Does disorder also inhibit prosocial behavior?

--

Or is this relationship spurious once collective efficacy is controlled, as suggest by Sampson?

* Is activation of collective efficacy conditional on offender characteristics?
* Does disorder moderate collective efficacy?

# Project Structure and Timeline

---

This study links field experiments embedded in Seattle neighborhoods 
to data from the 2002-2003 Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey.

--

The results represent the result of over 2000 person-hours of field work spread over four summers.

# Lost Letter

.pull-left[
![Mailbox Experiment](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/lost_letter.svg)
]

.pull-right[
* Based on Sampson's (2012) application of the Lost Letter Technique (Milgram et al. 1965) to obtain updated measure of collective efficacy.

* Returning a lost letter is a low-risk pro-social intervention.

* Varying the sender address allows for test of pro-social intervention sensitivity to contextual variation.
