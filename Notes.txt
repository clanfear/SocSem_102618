Abstract

Disorder and Social Control

Neighborhood disorder is highly-correlated with crime rates, which has led to a significant controversy in the social sciences
over the proper interpretation of the correlation. Does the correlation reflect a causal relationship, in
which social and physical disorder increases the likelihood of norm-violations and crime, as broken
windows theory suggests? Or does the correlation reflect a spurious relationship, in which the
correlation disappears when the confounding variable, neighborhood collective efficacy, is
controlled? The answer to this question has important theoretical and policy implications. This
project examines this controversy using mixed methods: field experiments embedded in
neighborhoods that are diverse on measures from the U.S. Census and the Seattle Neighborhoods
and Crime Survey.

Questions:

1) Do the theoretical diagrams and descriptions make sense?
2) What should I talk about with prosocial behavior?
  2.1) Note: Sanctioning is a manifestation of CE, and is a prosocial behavior
  2.2) Do we want to talk about risk / cost-benefit in prosocial behavior?
3) Check about research questions
4) Experiment diagram: Are we looking at path C... or not?
5) Mailbox: Prosocial behavior not shown... should we add it?
6) Should I put talk about sampling in appendix or upfront?

Ross:

1) Timeline and labor subordinate to main stuff
2) SEM replication in appendix, sidenote on S&R

Lindsey:

1) Always use path label letters
2) Make CE and social control clear: They're not exactly the same, but occupy same spot (mostly).
3) Make sure broad research questions there
4) Note geographic scope: Not just absolute, but relative to other projects

To do:

1) Findings tables for experiments
2) New experiment diagrams
3) Wording on BW slide for alienation from community social life; constraining social interaction
4) Talk about sampling---appendix maybe?
5) BRING ACTUAL MATERIALS AS PROPS!

Organization:
 Overview
 - BWT
 -- Cited as basis for order maintenance policing
 -- Outline of theory and graphical description
 - BWT vs CE

 Project Structure

 Experiments: (Highlight paths or boxes on diagrams)
 - Lost Letter
 -- 2,938 letters, 8 each type (10 additional), 122 tracts
 -- Tabular Results
 -- Letter Drop Maps for Effect
 - Mailbox
 -- 3,671 participants, (1870 C, 1801 T), 20 tracts
 -- Tabular Results
 - Littering
 -- Differential activation of social control against norm-violators (flagrant littering) by sex, race, and disorder.
 -- Boat Model? Causal from sex, race, disorder, non-causal from area CE
 -- 568 trials, (268 C, 273 T), 12 tracts
 -- Tabular Results
 - LitterCam
 -- Experiment failed due to high collective efficacy
 - Drive-By Littering, 24 drops
 -- Mostly null results, would probably need very large sample size. Labor intensive. Ethically questionable.
