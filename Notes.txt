Abstract

Disorder and Social Control

Neighborhood disorder is highly-correlated with crime rates, which has led to a significant controversy in the social sciences
over the proper interpretation of the correlation. Does the correlation reflect a causal relationship, in
which social and physical disorder increases the likelihood of norm-violations and crime, as broken
windows theory suggests? Or does the correlation reflect a spurious relationship, in which the
correlation disappears when the confounding variable, neighborhood collective efficacy, is
controlled? The answer to this question has important theoretical and policy implications. This
project examines this controversy using mixed methods: field experiments embedded in
neighborhoods that are diverse on measures from the U.S. Census and the Seattle Neighborhoods
and Crime Survey.

Other things I am talking about:
- Timeline and labor involved
- Results
- Prosocial behavior

Things I could talk about but wasn't planning on:
- SEM replications of S&R 1999
