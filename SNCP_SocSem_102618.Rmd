# Theoretical Framework 

### Neighborhood social control and crime

???

Our focus crime

Crime always has risks

Prosocial action does not always have risk but risk is an underappreciated element

---

# Broken Windows

[Wilson & Kelling (1982)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/) describe a system where community disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control to offenders and (2) decreases social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.

.pull-left60[

![Broken Windows](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/broken_windows_pretty.svg)

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* B, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* C, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.
]

.centernote[
*This model is under-identified without instruments or manipulations*
]

---

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson & Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy—the community's capacity for informal social control.

.pull-left60[
![Collective Efficacy](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/collective_efficacy_pretty.svg)
]

.pull-right40[
* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy—social control—which is exogenous (B, E).

* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.
]

.centernote[
*A, C, and E represent testable constraints on Broken Windows.*

# Prosocial Behavior and Risk

Our focus is on crime—which always has risks—but both Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy are also theories of **prosocial behavior**.

--

Broken windows implies disorder attenuates prosocial behavior through *fear of crime* and subsequent withdrawal from community life.

--

Collective efficacy also predicts non-sanctioning prosocial behavior:<sup>1</sup>
* Returning lost letters
* Voting
* Providing CPR

.footnote[[1] [Sampson (2012)](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo5514383.html)]


--

Engaging in social control—sanctioning—is a *risky prosocial behavior*.

--

Prosocial action does not always feature risk but *risks and costs of prosocial behavior are underappreciated elements*.

---

# Research Questions

Our goal is examination of the micro-processes that underlie Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy

--

Does disorder increase norm-violations and crime as suggested by Broken Windows?
* Does disorder also inhibit prosocial behavior?

--

Or is this relationship spurious once collective efficacy is controlled, as suggest by Sampson?
* Is activation of collective efficacy conditional on context?
* Does disorder moderate collective efficacy?

--

.centernote[
*To answer these questions, this study links field experiments embedded in Seattle neighborhoods to ecometric data from the 2002-2003 Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey.*

Paths E and C are hard to isolate

Can't use crime as an intervention

Crime is a rare event to observe

Sanctioning is difficult intervention

# The Experiments

# Lost Letter: Method

2,938 letters were dropped on Seattle sidewalks for passersby to encounter.

24 letters—8 of each type—were dropped in each census tract:
  * Charles F. Landers Sr. (Personal)
  * Friends of Black Lives Matter (BLM)
  * American Neo-Nazi Party (Nazi)

Mailed letters were received at a PO Box monitored by the research team

Letter ID numbers combine with hand-recorded drop locations to permit geotagging of letter returns.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Letter condition, area type (e.g. residential), and postmark date were also recorded. Addresses have also now been linked to election precincts (See Appendix).]

* Returning a lost letter is a low-risk pro-social intervention highly correlated with collective efficacy (G)<sup>1</sup>.

* This may be used to update the 2002-2003 SNCS collective efficacy measures which may have shifted over time.<sup>2</sup>

* Varying the sender address tests sensitivity of prosocial intervention to context.

Key Findings:

* Personal (0.346) and BLM (0.318) returns correlated with 2002-2003 collective efficacy.

* Nazi letter returns were uncorrelated with CE (.034) and less common.

* Return rates of Personal and BLM letters should provide a valid updated collective efficacy measure.

Logit model indicates CE predicts BLM and personal letters

Interaction with Nazi negates CE effect

BLM has a lower base return rate

## Littering Intervention: Method

A confederate walks down the street and flagrantly litters near a trash can in view of passersby.

--

Researchers record whether the confederate is sanctioned—a risky prosocial behavior—or the litter is disposed of by a participant—a low-risk prosocial behavior.

--

Litter and a sign board with graffiti are introduced to manipulate disorder.

--

Replicated with three confederates of varying sex and race to manipulate interpersonal context which may influence evaluations of risk:<sup>1</sup>
   * Black Male
   * White Male
   * White Female

.footnote[[1] Sex and race also interact with normative expectations.]
--

We conducted 576 trials in 12 Seattle census tracts.

We also evaluated if our interventions impacted throwing away the dropped litter—a low risk, non-confrontational prosocial action.

Key Findings:

* Disorder treatment reduces throwing away—a low risk prosocial action
   * This effect may be conditional on confederate characteristics
* Collective efficacy and letter returns do not predict throwing away

The experiment was abandoned after a small number of trials.

In Ravenna, residents reported the magazine racks on Nextdoor as an "eyesore".

--

Two magazine racks had locks cut and were removed.

--

Thus we were unable to continue experiment *because of collective efficacy* in an affluent neighborhood.

--

In contrast, one rack was left *for an entire year* in Capitol Hill without issue.

Maybe talk about Coleman and zeal

# Litter Clean-Up: Alternative

We supposed the speed of return of lost letters was correlated with clean-up time of trash

As a pilot, in selected trats, 24 pieces of litter were dropped in the same locations as lost letters and then checked three times over the course of a day.

Neither timing nor a binary measure of clean-up were found to be associated with either lost letter returns or overall collective efficacy.

---

# Synthesis

1. Disorder appears to attenuate low-risk prosocial action—mailing letters, throwing away litter—and may impact sanctioning as well.

2. Collective efficacy predicts some low-risk prosocial action—mailing lost letters—but not higher risk actions—sanctioning.

3. Context matters for prosocial behavior
   * Target characteristics impact sanctioning
   * Characteristics of letters impact mailing

4. This may suggest perceived costs—such as risk—are important considerations for neighborhood theories of crime.
   * Collective efficacy is correlated with risk factors—such as retaliation for sanctions
   * Disorder may be a signal for risks or other costs
   * Disorder may signal that interventions will have limited benefit

# Appendix: Structural Models

We replicated Sampson & Raudenbush (1999) but with an instrument for disorder to examine reciprocal effects.
   * Disorder in 2002-2003 instrumented by 1990 disorder
   * Collective Efficacy in 2002-2003 instrumented by 1990 social cohesion, reciprocated exchange, and intergenerational closure

Disorder predicts crime in both high and low crime neighborhoods.

Collective efficacy only predicts crime in low crime neighborhoods.

Disorder and collective efficacy have bidirectional negative relationship.
