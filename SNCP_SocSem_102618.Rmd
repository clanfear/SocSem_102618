# Theoretical Framework 

---

# Broken Windows

Wilson & Kelling (1982) describe a system where disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control and (2) decreases social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.

.pull-left60[

![Broken Windows](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/broken_windows.svg)

]

.pull-right40[

* Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* Disorder constrains social relations which impedes control.

* Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.
]

.centernote[
*Reciprocal relationship (B,C) defies observational tests.*
]

# Collective Efficacy

Sampson & Raudenbush (1999) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low social control.

.pull-left60[
![Collective Efficacy](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/collective_efficacy.svg)
]

.pull-right40[

* Disorder and crime are products of low social control.

* Disorder has no direct impact on crime or social control.

*(A,C) represent testable constraints on Broken Windows.*

# Project Structure and Timeline

---

This project links field experiments embedded in Seattle neighborhoods 
to data from the 2002-2003 Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey.

--

Our goal is estimation of the parameters that connect disorder, 
crime, and social control.

--

This subjects both Broken Windows and the Collective Efficacy counter-hypothesis
to formal tests.

--

This project represents over 2000 person-hours of field work spread over four summers.

# Lost Letter

.pull-left[
![Mailbox Experiment](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/lost_letter.svg)
]

.pull-right[
* Based on Sampson's (XXXX) application of Milgram (XXXX) to obtain updated measure of collective efficacy.

* Returning a lost letter is a low-risk pro-social intervention.

* Varying the sender address allows for test of pro-social intervention sensitivity to contextual variation.
