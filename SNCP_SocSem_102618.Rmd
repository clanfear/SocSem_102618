# Theoretical Framework 

### Neighborhood social control and crime

???

Our focus crime

Crime always has risks

Prosocial action does not always have risk but risk is an underappreciated element

---

# Broken Windows

[Wilson & Kelling (1982)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/) describe a system where community disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control to offenders and (2) decreases actual social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.
--

.pull-left60[

![Broken Windows](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/broken_windows_pretty.svg)

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* B, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* C, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.
]

.centernote[
*This model is under-identified without instruments or manipulations*
]

---

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson & Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy—the community's capacity for informal social control.
--

.pull-left60[
![Collective Efficacy](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/collective_efficacy_pretty.svg)
]

.pull-right40[
* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy—social control—which is exogenous (B, E).

* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.
]

.centernote[
*A, B, and E represent testable constraints on Broken Windows.*

# Key Studies

### [Keizer, Lindenberg, & Steg (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1161405)

### [Sampson & Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356)

## Keizer, Lindenberg, & Steg (2008)

Used disorder manipulations and recorded norm violation with field experiments in Grongingen, the Netherlands. Multiple interventions show a consistent positive relationship.

* Single sites in one city: No examination of context, indirect pathways, or reciprocal effects.

* High **internal validity** from experimental design.

.pull-right[
* Effect of disorder on crime (A) absent once controlling for collective efficacy (B,D)

* Control for crime impact on collective efficacy (E), but assume no disorder feedback on collective efficacy (C)

* High **external validity** using focal concepts: *Real* disorder and crime.
]

---
# Key Question

### How do we reconcile these results?

--

### *But first, an aside...*

---

# Prosocial Behavior and Risk

Our focus is on crime—which always has risks—but both Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy are also theories of **prosocial behavior**.

--

Broken windows implies disorder attenuates prosocial behavior through *fear of crime* and subsequent withdrawal from community life.

--

Collective efficacy predicts many prosocial behaviors:<sup>1</sup>
* Returning lost letters
* Voting
* Providing CPR
* Sanctioning norm-violators

.footnote[[1] [Sampson (2012)](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo5514383.html)]

--

Engaging in social control—sanctioning—is a *risky prosocial behavior*.

--

Prosocial action does not always feature risk but *risks and costs of prosocial behavior are underappreciated elements*.

---

# Research Questions

Our goal is testing the micro-level mechanisms that underlie Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy.

--

Does disorder increase norm-violations and crime as suggested by Broken Windows?
* Does disorder also inhibit prosocial behavior?

--

Or is this relationship spurious once collective efficacy is controlled, as suggested by Sampson?
* Is activation of collective efficacy conditional on context?
* Does disorder moderate collective efficacy?
* Does collective efficacy limit exposure to disorder via clean-up?

--

.centernote[
*To answer these questions, this study links field experiments embedded in Seattle neighborhoods to ecometric data from the 2002-2003 Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey.*

# Experiment Diagram

???

Paths E and C are hard to isolate

Can't use crime as an intervention

Crime is a rare event to observe

Sanctioning is difficult intervention

# The Experiments

---
# Lost Letter: Method

2,938 letters were dropped on Seattle sidewalks for passersby to encounter.

--

24 letters—8 per addressee—were dropped in each census tract:
  * Charles F. Landers Sr. (Personal)
  * Friends of Black Lives Matter (BLM)
  * American Neo-Nazi Party (Nazi)

--

Mailed letters were received at a PO Box monitored by the research team.

--

Letter ID numbers combine with hand-recorded drop locations to permit geotagging of letter returns.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Letter condition, area type (e.g. residential), and postmark date were also recorded. Addresses have also now been linked to election precincts (See Appendix).]

Key Findings:

* Personal (0.346) and BLM (0.318) returns correlated with 2002-2003 collective efficacy.

--

* Nazi letter returns uncorrelated with CE (.034) and less common.

--

* Return rates of Personal and BLM letters should provide a valid updated collective efficacy indicator.

Logit model indicates CE predicts BLM and personal letters

Interaction with Nazi negates CE effect

BLM has a lower base return rate

## Littering Intervention: Method

A confederate walks down the street and flagrantly litters near a trash can in view of passersby.

--

Researchers record whether the confederate is sanctioned—a risky prosocial behavior—or the litter is disposed of by a participant—a low-risk prosocial behavior.

--

Litter and a sign board with graffiti are introduced to manipulate disorder.

--

Replicated with three confederates of varying sex and race to manipulate interpersonal context which may influence evaluations of risk:<sup>1</sup>
   * Black Male
   * White Male
   * White Female

.footnote[[1] Sex and race also interact with normative expectations.]
--

We conducted 576 trials in 12 Seattle census tracts.

We also evaluated if our interventions impacted throwing away the dropped litter—a low risk, non-confrontational prosocial action.

--

Key Findings:

* Disorder treatment reduces throwing away.

    * This effect also conditional on confederate characteristics.
--

* Collective efficacy and letter returns do not predict throwing away.

* The experiment was abandoned after a small number of trials.

* In Ravenna, residents reported the magazine racks on Nextdoor as an "eyesore".

--

* Two magazine racks had locks cut and were removed.

--

* Thus we were unable to continue experiment *because of collective efficacy* in an affluent neighborhood.

--

* In contrast, one rack was left *for an entire year* in Capitol Hill without issue.

2\. Disorder attenuates low-risk, low-cost prosocial actions—mailing letters, throwing away litter—and possibly sanctioning as well (B).
   * Consistent with indirect Broken Windows pathway.
   
   * Suggests feedback effect on collective efficacy.

4\. Collective efficacy is associated with lower theft (C).
* Unable to explore mechanism.
* Possibly correlated with perceived *risk* of sanction or population composition.

# Prosocial Behavior
### Future research

*We know relatively little about the activation of prosocial behavior, particularly sanctioning.*

--

This study suggests contexts of prosocial behavior are important but neglected considerations for neighborhood theories of crime.

--

   * Collective efficacy is correlated with the presence of risk factors—such as retaliation from the sanctioned.

--

   * Disorder may be a signal for risks or other costs.

--

   * Disorder may signal that interventions will have limited benefit.

--

   * Context may cause general statements of prosocial intentions to differ sharply from actual behavior (see [St. Jean 2007](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo5298963.html)).

# Litter Clean-Up: Alternative

We supposed the speed of return of lost letters was correlated with clean-up time of trash.


As a pilot, in selected trats, 24 pieces of litter were dropped in the same locations as lost letters and then checked three times over the course of a day.


Neither timing nor a binary measure of clean-up were found to be associated with either lost letter returns or overall collective efficacy.

## Sampson & Raudenbush Replication

We replicated Sampson & Raudenbush (1999) but with an instruments for disorder and collective efficacy from Miethe (1990) to examine reciprocal effects.

   * Disorder in 2002-2003 instrumented by 1990 disorder.
   
   * Collective Efficacy in 2002-2003 instrumented by 1990 social cohesion, reciprocated exchange, and intergenerational closure.

Key Findings:

* Disorder predicts crime in both high and low crime neighborhoods.

* Collective efficacy only predicts crime in low crime neighborhoods.

* Disorder and collective efficacy have bidirectional negative relationship.
