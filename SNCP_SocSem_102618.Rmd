# Theoretical Framework 

### Neighborhood social control and crime


---

# Broken Windows

[Wilson & Kelling (1982)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/) describe a system where community disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control to offenders and (2) decreases social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.

.pull-left60[

![Broken Windows](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/broken_windows_pretty.svg)

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* B, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* C, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.
]

.centernote[
*This model is under-identified without instruments or manipulations*
]

---

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson & Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy—the community's capacity for informal social control.

.pull-left60[
![Collective Efficacy](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/collective_efficacy_pretty.svg)
]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.

* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy—social control—which is exogenous (B, E).
]

.centernote[
*A, C, and E represent testable constraints on Broken Windows.*

# Key Literature

.pull-left[
[**Sampson & Raudenbush (1999)**](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356)

* Instrumental variables model of Chicago neighborhoods

* Effect of disorder on crime (A) absent once controlling for collective efficacy (B,D)

* Controlled for effect of crime on collective efficacy (E), but assumed no effect of disorder on collective efficacy (C)
]

.pull-right[
[**Keizer et al. (2008)**](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1161405)

* Multiple field experiments in Grongingen, the Netherlands

* Strong causal effect of disorder on norm violation (A)

* No contextual controls: Single site per experiment

* No examination of indirect pathways or reciprocal effects
]

.centernote[
*How do we reconcile these results?*
]

# Prosocial Behavior

Engaging in social control—such as sanctioning—is a prosocial behavior

Collective efficacy also predicts non-sanctioning prosocial behavior—returning lost letters, providing CPR (Sampson, 2008)

Broken windows implies disorder attenuates prosocial action through social withdrawal

---

# Research Questions

Our goal is examination of the micro-processes that underlie Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy

--

Does disorder increase norm-violations and crime as suggested by Broken Windows?
* Does disorder also inhibit prosocial behavior?

--

Or is this relationship spurious once collective efficacy is controlled, as suggest by Sampson?
* Is activation of collective efficacy conditional on offender characteristics?
* Does disorder moderate collective efficacy?

--

*To answer these questions, this study links field experiments embedded in Seattle neighborhoods to data from the 2002-2003 Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey.*

Note: Maybe say here SNCS is used for CE?

   * Updated measure of collective efficacy

* Mailbox Experiment
   * Causal effect of disorder on norm violation (A)

# Lost Letter

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
* Based on Sampson's (2012) application of the Lost Letter Technique (Milgram et al. 1965) to obtain updated measure of collective efficacy.

* Returning a lost letter is a low-risk pro-social intervention.

* Varying the sender address tests sensitivity of prosocial intervention to context.
]

Notes: We aren't testing any path at all here. We could use the original diagram and add a box for prosocial action and an association link with collective efficacy.
 Maybe add to diagram the letter types as a box only connected to pro-social behavior

Notes:

* Personal (0.346) and BLM (0.318) returns correlated with collective efficacy
* Nazi letter returns uncorrelated with CE (.034)
* "This model indicates there is a positive relationship between collective efficacy and letter return rates for
BLM and personal letters, however the effect is almost completely negated for Nazi letters. BLM letters are
statistically significantly less likely to be mailed than personal letters once controlling for collective efficacy.""

Notes:

* CE does not predict sanctioning
* Letter returns weakly predict sanctioning (p~.245)
* Continuum of sanction prob
* Disorder reduces throwing away
* Disorder has only interactive effect on sanctioning: Reverse treatment effect for CL vs TP/LB
* Lindsey received more aggressive sanctions

# Litter Clean-Up

Notes: Here we would be observationally testing collective efficacy -> disorder (B)... or would we be testing collective efficacy -> prosocial behavior -> disorder?

Attempted to replace the experiment with drive-by littering but after 24 drops, null results

# Results

Notes: Interesting result. Unable to continue experiment *because of collective efficacy* in affluent neighborhood.

# Synthesis

Notes:

Disorder appears to attenuate prosocial action (mailbox experiment; what about littering?)

Collective efficacy predicts low risk prosocial action (lost letter, mailbox? (check), litter pickup)

CE predicts reduced theft, but not increased sanctioning

Interpersonal context appears to matter; context in general appears to matter (disorder is contextual info)

# Appendix 2: Mailbox

Regression table?

---
# Appendix 3: Littering Intervention

Regression table?

---
# Appendix 4: SEM

Restricted coefficient table, maybe model diagram with standardized values?

Note that we're using a model with instruments, two time periods, can control for disorder feedback

Looks like S&R if we omit things
