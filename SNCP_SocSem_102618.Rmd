# Theoretical Framework 

### Neighborhood social control and crime


---

# Broken Windows

[Wilson & Kelling (1982)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/) describe a system where community disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control to offenders and (2) decreases social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.

.pull-left60[

![Broken Windows](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/broken_windows_pretty.svg)

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* B, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* C, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.
]

.centernote[
*This model is under-identified without instruments or manipulations*
]

---

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson & Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy—the community's capacity for informal social control.

.pull-left60[
![Collective Efficacy](https://clanfear.github.io/SocSem_102618/img/collective_efficacy_pretty.svg)
]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.

* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy—social control—which is exogenous (B, E).
]

.centernote[
*A, C, and E represent testable constraints on Broken Windows.*

# Key Literature

.pull-left[
[**Sampson & Raudenbush (1999)**](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356)

* Instrumental variables model of Chicago neighborhoods

* Effect of disorder on crime (A) absent once controlling for collective efficacy (B,D)

* Controlled for effect of crime on collective efficacy (E), but assumed no effect of disorder on collective efficacy (C)
]

.pull-right[
[**Keizer et al. (2008)**](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1161405)

* Multiple field experiments in Grongingen, the Netherlands

* Strong causal effect of disorder on norm violation (A)

* No contextual controls: Single site per experiment

* No examination of indirect pathways or reciprocal effects
]

.centernote[
*How do we reconcile these results?*
]

# Prosocial Behavior

Engaging in social control—such as sanctioning—is a prosocial behavior

Collective efficacy also predicts non-sanctioning prosocial behavior—returning lost letters, providing CPR (Sampson, 2008)

Broken windows implies disorder attenuates prosocial action through social withdrawal

---

# Research Questions

Our goal is examination of the micro-processes that underlie Broken Windows and Collective Efficacy

--

Does disorder increase norm-violations and crime as suggested by Broken Windows?
* Does disorder also inhibit prosocial behavior?

--

Or is this relationship spurious once collective efficacy is controlled, as suggest by Sampson?
* Is activation of collective efficacy conditional on offender characteristics?
* Does disorder moderate collective efficacy?

--

*To answer these questions, this study links field experiments embedded in Seattle neighborhoods to data from the 2002-2003 Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey.*

Note: Maybe say here SNCS is used for CE?

# Experiments and Goals:

* Lost Letter
   * Updated measure of collective efficacy

* Mailbox Experiment
   * Causal effect of disorder on norm violation (A)
   
* Littering Intervention
   * Causal effect of disorder on sanctioning (B)
   * Causal effect of interpersonal context on sanctioning (this is *not* E)

* Based on Sampson's (2012) application of the Lost Letter Technique (Milgram et al. 1965) to obtain updated measure of collective efficacy.

* Returning a lost letter is a low-risk pro-social intervention.

* Varying the sender address tests sensitivity of prosocial intervention to context.
]

Notes: We aren't testing any path at all here. We could use the original diagram and add a box for prosocial action and an association link with collective efficacy.
 Maybe add to diagram the letter types as a box only connected to pro-social behavior

# Results

Notes:

* Personal (0.346) and BLM (0.318) returns correlated with collective efficacy
* Nazi letter returns uncorrelated with CE (.034)
* Check results from past memo, there's more here

Notes: We really are testing A. But we're also testing something else: Does disorder impact prosocial behavior, which is (in part) a product of collective efficacy. Add a new box for that? We are also observationally testing D.

# Results

* Disorder reduces mailing
* Disorder doesn't increase theft, even in a single location

Notes:

* CE does not predict sanctioning
* Race/gender of confederate impacts sanctioning
* CE predicts throwing litter away (low cost intervention)
* Disorder reduces throwing away, odd effect on sanctioning

Notes: Here we would be observationally testing collective efficacy -> disorder (B)... or would we be testing collective efficacy -> prosocial behavior -> disorder?

Attempted to replace the experiment with drive-by littering but after 24 drops, null results

Notes: Interesting result. Unable to continue experiment *because of collective efficacy* in affluent neighborhood.

# Synthesis

Notes:

Disorder appears to attenuate prosocial action (mailbox experiment; what about littering?)

Collective efficacy predicts low risk prosocial action (lost letter, mailbox? (check), litter pickup)

CE predicts reduced theft, but not increased sanctioning

Interpersonal context appears to matter; context in general appears to matter (disorder is contextual info)
